# **Meeny BETA**
Meeny is a Discord app made by CrusherNotDrip out of boredom

## **Creating an App**
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) then Login if you haven't already
2. Click/Tap on `New Application` located in the top right
3. Name your application anything you want and accept the **Discord Developer TOS and Developer Policy** then click create
4. When you click on `Bot` one should be generated for you
5. Click on `Reset Token` and it should give you another one. Keep that token somewhere as we are gonna put it in a secret file
6. Also copy the `Application ID` from the `General Information` tab as we will also need that later
7. Done!

## **Setting up a bot**
1. In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in your App there should be an `Installation` button
2. This one uses `User Install` and `Guild Install` so make sure to click on both of them
3. These are the permissions used since im too lazy to list them all off but make sure these permissions are on
